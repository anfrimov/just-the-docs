## Content

Generally contains the contents of any [package files]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Imports/Imports.md %}) (`.unitypackage` extension) that were imported into the project. The Leap packages all unpack to this location; however, [UXF]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/UXF/UXF.md %}) unpacks [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/UXF/UXF.md %}) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/WebGLTemplates/WebGLTemplates.md %}) (you can see where a package's files will be unpacked during the import process in Unity).
