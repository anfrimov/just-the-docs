# Packages

Contains information for Unity about any packages that have been installed in the project and facilitates the removal of those packages from the project via the PackageManager. This includes packages such as [Leap]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Plugins/Plugins.md %}) and [UXF]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/UXF/UXF.md %}). The package files used in this project have been included in the repository [here](({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Imports/Imports.md %})), though their contents have already been unpacked into the project somewhere in the [Assets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Assets.md %}) folder.
