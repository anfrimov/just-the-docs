# Plugins

Generally contains the contents of any [package files]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Imports/Imports.md %}) (`.unitypackage` extension) that were imported into the project, with the exception of [UXF]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/UXF/UXF.md %}) which unpacks [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/UXF/UXF.md %}) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/WebGLTemplates/WebGLTemplates.md %}) (you can see where a package's files will be unpacked during the import process in Unity). The Leap packages all unpack to this location.
