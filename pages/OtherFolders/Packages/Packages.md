# Packages
Information for Unity about any packages that have been installed in the project.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Content

Contains files to track packages imported into the Unity project and facilitates the removal of those packages from the project via the PackageManager. This includes packages such as [Leap]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Plugins/Plugins.md %}) and [UXF]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/UXF/UXF.md %}). The package files used in this project have been included in the repository [here](({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Imports/Imports.md %})), though their contents have already been unpacked into the project in the [Assets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Assets.md %}) folder.
