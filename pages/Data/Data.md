## Content

This directory is automatically populated as subjects participate in the task. Each folder within this directory corresponds to a different experiment based on the same project. The rationale is that a single Unity project using UXF can be used for multiple experiments if the settings in the settings.json file change between each one. Therefore the names of these subdirectories are given by the corresponding settings.json file.

Each experiment directory contains one or more session folders (this experiment only has one session, and therefore only one session folder). Within the session folder is each participant folder, named for that participant's personal identification code.
