# UserSettings

This directory contains user-specific preferences and should therefore not be necessary to the proper functioning of the project. It should not be included when copying the project and should perhaps not have been included in this repository. I have saved it here only on the off-chance that it could be useful to someone at some point, though this is unlikely.
