# Library

Contains necessary files for executing the project. The files here are not included in the repository and do not need to be copied when transferring the project to another computer because Unity will generate them automatically based on the files in [Assets]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/Assets/Assets.md %}) and [ProjectSettings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.md %}).
